# Why We Don't Use A Build Trigger
* 'Build after other projects are built' is not a good choice in this case
* Traceability suffers
* Useful for downstream and cleanup jobs

Nachverfolgbarkeit von Fehlern leidet
Daher nicht zu empfehlen bei upstream jobs

#Chaining
* `Clone Workspace SCM Plug-in`
  - Since jenkins 2.1 multiple SCM can be used
* Alternatively: Use Artifacts

#Complex build chains
* `conditional-buildstep` plugin
 - Build steps executed on bool conditions
* `Multi-job` plugin
 - Allows running jobs in parallel
 - Looks fancy

## Automating The Package Building Process

****

## Create a new job

* TODO: More details, step-by-step
* You know how to do this!
* For building this job needs the contents of both the `searchengine` and the `searchengine_build_files`
* Intended directory structure:

    @@@ Shell
	$Workplace
	  \__init__.py 
	  \searchengine.py 
	  \setup.py
	  \debian
	    \changelog
		\compat
		\control
		\copyright
		\rules

* The buildstep only needs to run

    @@@ Shell
    debuild --no-tgz-check -uc -us


## Chain the jobs

* Use a post-build action in the Python project to make sure the packaging job runs after it
* TODO Screenshot
