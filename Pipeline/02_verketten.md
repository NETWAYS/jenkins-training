****

## Automating The Package Building Process

****

## Create a new job that is run after the first

* You should be able to create jobs by now
* Add this second job to the first 'Post-Build Actions'

## Include the `suchmaschine_build_files.tar`

* Extract them with `tar xzvf suchmaschine_build_files.tar`
* Either create an additional repository
* Or add them to the first repository

## Make sure all required files are in the right place

* The build files need to be inside the 'suchumaschine' directory
* You need most files from the 'suchmaschine'-project

## Create the package

* `debuild --no-tgz-check` should work if everything is in the rigth place
* You may have to import the gpg key
