* Single step jobs have limited usabilty
* Jobs can be chained together using conditions

# Why We Don't Use A Build Trigger
* 'Build after other projects are built' is not a good choice in this case
* Traceability suffers
* Useful for downstream and cleanup jobs

Nachverfolgbarkeit von Fehlern leidet
Daher nicht zu empfehlen bei upstream jobs

#Chaining
* `Clone Workspace SCM Plug-in`
  - Since jenkins 2.1 multiple SCM can be used
* Alternatively: Use Artifacts

#Complex build chains
* `conditional-buildstep` plugin
 - Build steps executed on bool conditions
* `Multi-job` plugin
 - Allows running jobs in parallel
 - Looks fancy

## Automating The Package Building Process

****

## Create a new job

* You know how to do this!
* See earlier Labs for more info

## Multiple SCMs

* You can define as many Repositories as you want

## Build inside Docker

See Docker Lab for further information

~~~PAGEBREAK~~~

## Archive artifacts
* Archiving artifacts makes Jenkins keep them across builds
* It also saves them from being destroyed along with the Docker container
<img src="./_img/post_build.png" style="width:600px">

## Buildstep
Add as a new 'Execute Shell'-command:

    @@@ Shell
	# Build the package
    debuild --no-tgz-check -uc -us

	# Move the package back into the workspace (debuild is weird)
	mv ../*.deb .


## Model the build dependencies

* Use a post-build action in the Python project to make sure the packaging job runs after it
